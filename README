Due:
    Test .. 12/1/2025
    Everything else ... 12/7/2025


Assignment:

   Part a:

       - [15%] submit, improve, and review as many correct and useful public tests as you want
               via pull requests https://github.com/utgheith/p3
       - [15%] submit a correct and useful private test. Has to be different from
               the public tests
       - [70%] pass all tests

    Part b:

       - Enable limited static assertions in your implementation of fun from p4.
            * only work with
                - literals
                - assignment statements
                - initialized variable declarations
                - sequential composition of the above


Test structure:

    You need to supply 2 files per test (they'll be supplied to the verifier together).

        - <test_name>.dfy          can't be edited, contains the test
        - proofs/test_name>.dfy    can be edited, contains the proofs to be supplied by 
                                   students

    Rules:
        - can not change the test file (unless a bug is discovered and the group decides
          to accept a patch)

        - all functions, methods, predicates, and lemmas in the proof file need to
          to have the {:induction false}
