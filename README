Preview window: 10/31/2025 11/3/2025
Due: 11/14/2025

Assignment:

     - update the typer (initially in Typer.hs) in order to implement our new
       typing rules.

     - submit a private test case (<your csid>.ok, <your csid>.fun) in your private
       repo

     - submit as many public test cases as you want by making a pull request

The public repo:

     - contains the initial spec (FunSyntax.hs and Small.hs)

     - contains the test harness in Haskell

     - contains the shared pool of unit tests (in test) and end end-to-end
       tests (in *.fun, *.ok)

     - you can always submit pull requests:
           - tests will be easy to merge
           - spec changes will be limited to significant bug and/or spec
             clarifications and would require consensus

Your private repo:

     - will be created on 11/2/2025, once the preview period expires
     
     - your implementation should go there

     - you are free to choose your implementation language and specifics
       provided that:

          (1) you adhere to the spec in the common repo
          (2) you adhere to the naming conventions for end-to-end tests
          (3) you adhere to the Makefile interface


     - you can start your implementation before the end of the preview window
       but please make sure you don't push your implementation to the shared repo.
